YOLOv5 Tomato Shelf Life Prediction 🍅🔍

This project utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to predict the shelf life of tomatoes based on images or videos. The model detects and classifies tomatoes at different stages of ripeness, providing valuable insights for food processing and quality control.

Features ✨

- Object detection and classification of tomatoes using YOLOv5.
- Adjustable confidence threshold for precise predictions.
- Supports various image and video formats for flexibility in input data.
- Generates visualizations and statistical summaries of tomato classifications.

Installation 🛠️

To use the YOLOv5 Tomato Shelf Life Prediction tool, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies
3. Download the pre-trained YOLOv5 weights file (`best.pt`) and place it in the appropriate directory.
4. Run the Streamlit app using the command `streamlit run app.py`.

Usage 🚀

1. Use the slider to adjust the confidence threshold for tomato detection.
2. Upload an image or video file containing tomatoes.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to initiate the prediction process.
4. View the detected tomato classifications and their confidence scores in the generated DataFrame.
5. Visualize the detected tomatoes overlaid on the input image or video.
